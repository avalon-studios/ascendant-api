## Dilemma the Game
- Team Name: Avalon Studio
- Members: Kyle Bashour, Joseph Connor, Elliot Greenlee, Tyler Stuessi

## Description

Dilemma is a networked multiplayer game created with mobile devices in mind. Based off of the board [Scruples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scruples_(game)), we will adapt gameplay to work well on mobile devices, and allow anyone with the app to join in a game. 

We plan to build the backend in Python, with a mobile application written in Swift for our first client. The backend will manage game play, and will use WebSockets to communicate with clients for real time updates. 

Our team definitely has the experience to build this; Kyle Bashour interned at mobile devshop Metova over the summer, and has experience building apps on iOS (the first platform we'll target). Tyler Stuessi has experience with networking and Python through is job at OIT. Joseph Connor has tons of experience working with backends and networking through an internship at Cisco. Elliot Greenlee learned mysterious things he cannot talk about during his time at L3.
