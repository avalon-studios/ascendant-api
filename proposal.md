## Description

[Avalon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Resistance_(game)#Avalon_variant) is a word-of-mouth game usually played with a deck of cards. Our proposal is rebuild it as a networked multiplayer game for iOS (and possibly other platforms in the future). The game would work exceedingly well as an app, as it is somewhat confusing to play with a deck of cards.

We plan to build the backend in Python, with a mobile application written in Swift for our first client. The backend will manage game play, and will use WebSockets or TCP to communicate with clients for real time updates. 

Our team definitely has the experience to build this; Kyle Bashour interned at mobile devshop Metova over the summer, and has experience building apps on iOS (the first platform we'll target). Tyler Stuessi has experience with networking and Python through is job at OIT. Joseph Connor has tons of experience working with backends and networking through an internship at Cisco. Elliot Greenlee learned mysterious things he cannot talk about during his time at L3.
