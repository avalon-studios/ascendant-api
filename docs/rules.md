## Ascendant

Ascendant pits a team of Space Explorers on board the USS Ascendant against a nasty bunch of Mutineers. Lost on the edges of the universe, the explorers must complete three missions to return home. If the mutineers manage to thwart three missions, they gain control of the ship — and our explorers are lost forever. 

## Gameplay

Ascendant can be played with 5-10 players. After everyone has joined the game, they'll be randomly assigned to **Space Explorer** (green) or **Mutineer** (red). 2/3 of the players will be Explorers; 1/3 Mutineers. When everybody is ready to join, the first turn begins. 

### How a turn plays out

In Ascendant, a turn is based around a **leader**. The leader will be asked to **pick a team** for a mission. If the leader is a Mutineer, they will know who else is a Mutineer. However, Explorers do not know who is on which team. After the leader has picked the mission team, everybody votes on whether to accept this team and continue with the mission. **These votes are public**, and will be displayed to everyone after the vote is finished. 

The votes passes with a majority vote, also passing in the event of a tie. When a vote passes, the players selected for this mission each vote to either **pass** or **fail** the mission. **Just one fail vote** is required to fail the entire mission. The result of the mission is displayed, and the next leader is selected. 

If the vote fails, then there is no mission voting and next leader is selected. However, if **five** mission proposals fail in a row, then the Mutineers have thwarted the Explorers, and take control of the ship to win!

### Winning the game

To win the game, the Explorers must pass three missions. However, if three missions fail, the Mutineers win the game. The mutineers can also win the game if five mission proposals fail in a row. However, since the Explorers always have a majority, there's almost no reason for the game to end this way.
